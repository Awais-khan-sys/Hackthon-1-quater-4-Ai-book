# Quickstart: Digital Twin Simulation Module

## Overview
This module introduces digital twins and physics-based simulation for humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity. The content is structured in three progressive chapters that build from fundamental concepts to practical applications.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Module 1 (ROS 2 Fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with simulation concepts (helpful but not required)

## Chapter Sequence
1. **Digital Twins & Physics Simulation** - Understand what digital twins are and how physics engines simulate gravity and collisions in Gazebo
2. **Simulation Environments** - Learn to build robot worlds in Gazebo and understand high-fidelity interaction in Unity
3. **Sensor Simulation** - Explore LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs and how to use simulated sensors for AI training

## Learning Approach
- Concept-first methodology with minimal code examples
- Progressive complexity from theory to practical application
- Focus on understanding simulation's role in Physical AI development

## Navigation
- Each chapter builds on the previous one
- Use the sidebar navigation to move between chapters
- Review learning objectives at the beginning of each chapter
- Complete the exercises to reinforce concepts

## Next Steps
After completing this module, students will be ready to proceed to Module 3 (Isaac) with a solid understanding of simulation concepts in Physical AI.
