# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module. This module explains how language models, perception, and robotics actions converge to create autonomous humanoid behavior. This content is designed for AI/robotics students familiar with ROS 2, simulation, and navigation concepts.

## Overview

The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework represents a unified approach to autonomous humanoid behavior, integrating three critical components:

- **Vision**: Perception systems that understand the environment
- **Language**: Natural language processing for human interaction
- **Action**: Robotics execution systems that perform physical tasks

This integration enables robots to understand human commands, plan complex actions, and execute them in real-world environments.

## Module Structure

This module consists of three interconnected chapters:

### 1. Voice-to-Action
Learn how to convert spoken commands into robot actions using speech-to-text technology and intent translation. Understand speech recognition, intent mapping, and voice command processing with OpenAI Whisper.

### 2. Cognitive Planning with LLMs
Discover how Large Language Models can be used for task decomposition and converting natural language goals into executable ROS 2 action sequences. Explore the cognitive layer of autonomous humanoid behavior.

### 3. Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid
Implement an end-to-end VLA pipeline that integrates voice commands through planning → navigation → perception → manipulation to build a complete autonomous humanoid system.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Understanding of ROS 2 concepts
- Basic knowledge of robotics navigation and perception
- Familiarity with simulation environments

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will understand:
- How to process voice commands for robot control
- How to use LLMs for task planning in robotics
- How to integrate multiple systems into a complete autonomous humanoid
- The complete flow from voice command to robot manipulation

## Navigation

This module is organized sequentially to build your understanding progressively:

1. Start with [Voice-to-Action](./voice-to-action) to understand the foundational communication layer
2. Continue with [Cognitive Planning with LLMs](./cognitive-planning) to learn about task decomposition
3. Complete with [The Autonomous Humanoid](./autonomous-humanoid) to see the full integration
