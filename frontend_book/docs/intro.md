# Introduction to ROS 2 Fundamentals

Welcome to the ROS 2 Fundamentals Module, part of a comprehensive Physical AI textbook. This module is designed to explain ROS 2 as the middleware connecting AI agents to humanoid robots.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you will explore:

- The fundamental concepts of ROS 2 and its role as middleware
- Different communication patterns in ROS 2
- How to model humanoid robots using URDF

This content is designed for Python-literate AI/robotics students who are new to ROS 2. No prior ROS experience is required, but familiarity with Python programming is expected.

## Getting Started

Begin with the [ROS 2 Fundamentals](./ros-module/fundamentals.md) chapter to establish the foundational knowledge needed for understanding how AI agents communicate with robotic systems through ROS 2.
